  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout -- the professional-services analog of
  `cloud-itonami-isic-8620`'s `clinic.phase`.

    Phase 0  read-only        -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-intake  -- engagement intake allowed, every
                                 write needs human approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-verify  -- adds deliverable verification +
                                 chain-of-title/credential screening
                                 writes, still approval.
    Phase 3  supervised auto  -- governor-clean, high-confidence
                                 `:engagement/intake` (no capital risk
                                 yet) may auto-commit. `:actuation/
                                 issue-deliverable` NEVER auto-commits,
                                 at any phase.

  `:actuation/issue-deliverable` is deliberately ABSENT from every
  phase's `:auto` set, including phase 3 -- a permanent structural
  fact, not a rollout milestone still to come. Issuing a real
  deliverable or attestation is the ONE real-world act this actor
  performs; it is always a human licensed-professional call.
  `proserv.governor`'s `:actuation/issue-deliverable` high-stakes gate
  enforces the same invariant independently -- two layers, not one,
  agree on this. `:chainoftitle/screen`/`:credential/screen` are
  likewise never auto-eligible, at any phase -- the same posture
  every sibling's screening op has. Phase 3's `:auto` set here has
  only ONE member (`:engagement/intake`) -- this domain has no
  separate no-capital-risk 'file' lifecycle distinct from the
  engagement itself.")
